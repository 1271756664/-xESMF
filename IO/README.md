# PyEarthScience - IO

In this section you can find some python scripts which demonstrate the use 
of xarray and PyNIO to read and write netCDF files.

_**Work in progress**_


## Content

 - NetCDF
	+ Demonstrate the use of xarray to open and read coordinate and variable data from netCDF file.
	+ Demonstrate the use of PyNIO to open and read coordinate and variable data from netCDF file.
 
 - GRIB
	+ Demonstrate the use of xarray/cfgrib to open and read coordinate and variable data from GRIB file.
	+ Demonstrate the use of PyNIO to open and read coordinate and variable data from GRIB file.
 

### Scripts

 - xarray
	+ read_netCDF_with_xarray.py - open a netCDF file and demonstrate how to work with an xarray dataset
	+ read_GRIB_with_xarray.py   - open a GRIB file and demonstrate how to work with an xarray dataset


 - PyNIO
	+ read_netCDF_with_PyNIO.py - open a netCDF file and demonstrate how to work with PyNIO and numpy features
	+ read_GRIB_with_PyNIO.py   - open a GRIB file and demonstrate how to work with PyNIO and numpy features
