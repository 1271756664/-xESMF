# PyEarthScience - IO
In this section you can find some python scripts which demonstrate the use 
of xarray and PyNIO to read and write netCDF files.

_**Work in progress**_

## Content

 - demonstrate the use of xarray to open and read coordinate and variable data from netCDF file.
 - demonstrate the use of PyNIO to open and read coordinate and variable data from netCDF file.
 

### Scripts

 + read_netCDF_with_xarray.py - open a netCDF file and demonstrate how to work with an xarray dataset

#### PyNIO

 + read_netCDF_with_PyNIO.py - open a netCDF file and demonstrate how to work with PyNIO and numpy features
