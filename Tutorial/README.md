# PyEarthScience: Tutorial

### Author: Karin Meier-Fleischer, DKRZ

This tutorial will give an introduction into the software which is needed for 
the use of PyNGL.

More precisely, this is a collection of jupyter notebooks for Python, IO of 
scientific datasets (ASCII, netCDF, GRIB), computing, and plotting. While the 
main focus is on PyNGL, numpy, PyNIO, and xarray. 

It should also be mentioned that it was written from the point of view of NCL
users to find an easier way into the Python world.
