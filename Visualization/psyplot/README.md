# psyplot

This package has been developed by **Philipp Sommer** (Chilipp).

**psyplot** is an open source python project that mainly combines the plotting utilities
of matplotlib and the data management of the xarray package. The main purpose is to
have a framework that allows a fast, attractive, flexible, easily applicable, easily
reproducible and especially an interactive visualization of your data.

The ultimate goal is to help scientists and especially climate model developers in
their daily work by providing a flexible visualization tool that can be enhanced
by their own visualization scripts. psyplot can be used through the python command
line and through the psyplot-gui module which provides a graphical user interface
for an easier interactive usage.

The package is very new and there are many features that will be included in the future. 
So we are very pleased for feedback! Please simply raise an issue on GitHub (see also 
How to contribute in the docs).

You can see the full documentation on readthedocs.org.
